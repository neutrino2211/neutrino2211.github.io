At the inaugral Cybersecurity Day of the Nigerian Airforce Institute of Technology, Kaduna. I had the opporunity to speak on one of the internal red-team tools I developed at cyberplural.

The talk was majorly a demonstration of the tool itself and the dangers of phishing. After the introduction, the session became interactive and I had fun interacting with the students and learning about the technical limitations of the tool and possible phishing scenarios.
